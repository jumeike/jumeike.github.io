(2) How much faster can architectural simulations run by tuning system configurations? (3) What are the opportunities in accelerating software simulation using hardware accelerators? We choose gem5 as the representative architectural simulator, run several simulations with various configurations, perform a detailed architectural analysis of the gem5 source code on different server platforms, tune both system and architectural settings for running simulations, and discuss the future opportunities in accelerating gem5 as an important application. Our detailed profiling of gem5 reveals that its performance is extremely sensitive to the size of the L1 cache. Our experimental results show that a RISC-V core with 32KB data and instruction cache improves gem5’s simulation speed by 31%∼61% compared with a baseline core with 8KB L1 caches. Our paper is the first step toward building specialized hardware and software environments for accelerating software-based simulators.","tags":null,"title":"Profiling gem5 Simulator","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"As part of the IEEE proceedings, our paper “profiling gem5 simulator” has been accepted into ISPASS 23’.\n","date":1677542400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677542400,"objectID":"d9cfc7a9d756d2a010e13ea6d11dcf56","permalink":"https://jumeike.github.io/news/2023-cnrs-start.html","publishdate":"2023-02-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2023-cnrs-start.html","section":"news","summary":"Our paper on accelerating software-based architectural simulator has been accepted into ISPASS 2023.","tags":["Personal"],"title":"Profiling gem5 paper accepted to ISPASS 23'","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"As part of ASPLOS 23’ workshop session, our research on accelerating architectural simulators has been accepted to the FireSim users and developers workshop.\n","date":1677196800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677196800,"objectID":"ee15b0519ba5c1c945f26268fe2520de","permalink":"https://jumeike.github.io/news/2023-lammpstutorial-v2.0.html","publishdate":"2023-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2023-lammpstutorial-v2.0.html","section":"news","summary":"Neel is presenting our work at FireSim workshop in conjuction with ASPLOS 23'","tags":["Personal"],"title":"Accelerating gem5 work accepted to FireSim Workshop at ASPLOS 23'","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" Tests\n","date":1674172800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674172800,"objectID":"60e79cb28829481c20d3db0f4695ad7c","permalink":"https://jumeike.github.io/blog/about-me.html","publishdate":"2023-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/about-me.html","section":"blog","summary":"Details.","tags":[],"title":"About Me","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My abstract was selected as the top nine amongst others to participate in the IEEE ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) at the upcoming MICRO 22’ conference in Chicago.\n","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"ca2f2b06ad2cec8d2c8bb92b5ae01a9b","permalink":"https://jumeike.github.io/news/2023-micro-src.html","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2023-micro-src.html","section":"news","summary":"Johnson is presenting a poster at ACM Student Research Competition in MICRO 22'","tags":["Personal"],"title":"Selected to present my poster at the ACM SRC competition","type":"news"},{"authors":["Jack Ratcliffe","**Nick Ballou**","Laurissa Tokarchuk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639008e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639008e3,"objectID":"0d0400674d84f312bdc0c2ab5c26ea85","permalink":"https://jumeike.github.io/example/2021-ratcliffe-et-al-actions.html","publishdate":"2021-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/2021-ratcliffe-et-al-actions.html","section":"example","summary":"Modern immersive virtual reality (IVR) often uses embodied con- trollers for interacting with virtual objects. However, it is not clear how we should conceptualise these interactions. They could be con- sidered either gestures, as there is no interaction with a physical object; or as actions, given that there is object manipulation, even if it is virtual. This distinction is important, as literature has shown that in the physical world, action-enabled and gesture-enabled learning produce distinct cognitive outcomes. This study attempts to understand whether sensorimotor-embodied interactions with objects in IVR can cognitively be considered as actions or gestures. It does this by comparing verb-learning outcomes between two conditions: (1) where participants move the controllers without touching virtual objects (gesture condition); and (2) where partici- pants move the controllers and manipulate virtual objects (action condition). We found that (1) users can have cognitively distinct outcomes in IVR based on whether the interactions are actions or gestures, with actions providing stronger memorisation outcomes; and (2) embodied controller actions in IVR behave more similarly to physical world actions in terms of verb memorization benefits.","tags":null,"title":"Actions, not gestures: contextualising embodied controller interactions in immersive virtual reality","type":"example"},{"authors":["**Nick Ballou**","Heiko Breitsohl","Dominic Kao","Kathrin Gerling","Sebastian Deterding"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1634515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634515200,"objectID":"534111fa1d721b0d5f5d0307b385727c","permalink":"https://jumeike.github.io/example/2021-ballou-et-al-not-very-effective.html","publishdate":"2021-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/2021-ballou-et-al-not-very-effective.html","section":"example","summary":"Effectance—the basic positive experience of causing effects—provides a promising explanation for the enjoyment derived from novel low-challenge game genres featuring ample ‘juicy’ feedback. To date, game researchers have studied effectance using a little-validated 11-item scale developed by Klimmt, Hartmann, and Frey. To test its dimensionality and discriminant validity, we conducted an online survey (n = 467) asking people to report on effectance and related experiences in a recent play session. Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses show poor fit with a unidimensional factor structure and poor discriminant validity with common enjoyment and mastery/competence measures, likely due to reverse-coded items and a separable input lag factor.

While they are frequently treated as a monolithic feature of games by researchers and policymakers, loot box implementations are not uniform: the features of loot boxes vary from game to game in ways that may have important consequences for player spending and behaviour. Despite this, previous attempts to classify loot boxes have either not focused on the impact of loot box features on player behaviour and spending, or have not attempted to fully map the different forms that loot boxes currently take. In this work, we attempt to illustrate the nuance present in loot box implementation in a featural model. Using our lived experience, a qualitative coding exercise, and consultation with an industry professional, we identify thirty-two features of loot box-like mechanics that might be expected to influence player behavior or spending, which we group into five domains: point of purchase, pulling procedure, contents, audiovisual presentation, and salience. Each feature is broken down into two or more categorization tags for a given loot box, and illustrative examples of each feature are provided. This work may serve to guide researchers in studying how different types of loot boxes may affect players, aid regulators in ensuring that any proposed legislation is sufficiently nuanced to handle the wide variation in loot box design, and help parents and players to better understand the inner workings of loot boxes during play.","tags":null,"title":"The Hidden Intricacy of Loot Box Design: A Granular Description of Random Monetized Reward Features","type":"example"},{"authors":["**Nick Ballou**","Antonius J Van Rooij"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1599782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599782400,"objectID":"35283ed682647103d998c77f611d922e","permalink":"https://jumeike.github.io/example/2020-ballou-van-rooij-relationship.html","publishdate":"2020-08-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/example/2020-ballou-van-rooij-relationship.html","section":"example","summary":"Gaming disorder (also known as dysregulated gaming) has received significant research and policy attention based on concerns that certain patterns of play are associated with decreased mental well-being and/or functional impairment. In this study, we use specification curve analysis to examine analytical flexibility and the strength of the relationship between dysregulated gaming and well-being in the form of general mental health, depressive mood, and life satisfaction. Dutch and Flemish gamers (n = 424) completed ﬁve unique dysregulated gaming measures (covering nine scale variants) and three well-being measures. We find a consistent negative relationship; across 972 justifiable regression models, the median standardized regression coefficient was –0.40 (min: –0.54, max: –0.19). Data show that the majority of dysregulated gaming operationalizations converge upon highly similar estimates of well-being (i.e. have similar concurrent validity). However, variance is introduced by the choice of well-being measure; results indicate that dysregulated gaming is more strongly associated with depressive mood than with life satisfaction. Weekly gametime accounted for little to no unique variance in well-being in the sample. We argue that research on this topic should compare a broad range of functional and well-being outcomes, and work to identify a maximally parsimonious of dysregulated gaming criteria. Given somewhat minute differences between dysregulated gaming scales when used in survey-based studies and largely equivalent relationships with mental health indicators, harmonization of measurement should be a priority.","tags":null,"title":"The relationship between mental well-being and dysregulated gaming: A specification curve analysis of five gaming disorder scales","type":"example"},{"authors":["David Zendle","Rachel Meyer","**Nick Ballou**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588809600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588809600,"objectID":"5b78e5980d4842d046513dbcad4068c0","permalink":"https://jumeike.github.io/example/2019-zendle-et-al-changing-face.html","publishdate":"2020-01-04T13:58:37.322112Z","relpermalink":"/example/2019-zendle-et-al-changing-face.html","section":"example","summary":"It is now common practice for video game companies to not just sell copies of games themselves, but to also sell in-game bonuses or items for a small real-world fee.
