**About me**

I am a 2nd Year computer science PhD student at the University of Kansas advised by [Prof. Mohammad Alian](https://alian.ku.edu). In my work so far in the [Architecture Research Group](https://arg.ku.edu/), we have explored the optimization of software-based architectural simulators to enable efficient computer design and reduce energy costs. I am also working on “Device-less Networking” which investigates efficient CPU architecture for improved I/O performance.

**Research Interest**

* Computer Architecture
* Data Center Networking
* Operating Systems
* Emerging Technologies
