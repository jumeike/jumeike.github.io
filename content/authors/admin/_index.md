**About me**
I am currently pursuing a MS/PhD in computer engineering/computer science as a second-year student at the University of Kansas under the guidance of [Professor Mohammad Alian](https://alian-eecs.ku.edu). Within the [Architecture Research Group](https://arg.ku.edu/), my focus has been on optimizing software-based architectural simulators and working to push the boundaries of what is possible in data center networks. As part of my academic involvement, I am a member of [NSBE](https://www.nsbe.org/), [ACM](https://www.acm.org/), [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) and work as a student researcher at the [ACE Center for Evolvable Computing](https://acecenter.grainger.illinois.edu/).

In the captivating domain of computer architecture, I have dedicated myself to the creation of cutting-edge hardware designs. Notably, I've contributed to the optimization of software architectural simulation tools like gem5, a cornerstone of the computer architecture community. My work here is fueled by a commitment to amplifying system performance while mitigating energy consumption. Exploring the intricate landscape of operating systems, I seek to enhance resource management and elevate system-level performance. For instance, I'm currently exploring novel CPU notification techniques for improving the performance of data center applications in today's multi-gigabit/terabit networks where the bottleneck has moved from the network fabric to the host. The goal of my work here is to overcome interrupt and polling overheads in today's systems where the advancement in CPU designs has slowed down due to end of Moore's law compared to other I/O technologies. Computer networking stands as another captivating arena, where I delve into the network stack, and scalability to forge resilient and efficient communication infrastructures. Related to host system overhead, I explore different mechanisms for efficient communication especially in the face of the "killer microsecond" and data center taxes.

**Research Interest**
_Computer Architecture, Data Center Networking, Operating Systems, Machine Learning, High-Performance Computing, Emerging Technologies_


My research and academic pursuits traverse the diverse realms of computer science and engineering, where my fascination lies in crafting innovative solutions that redefine performance, energy efficiency, and resource management.
