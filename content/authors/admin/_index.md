**About me**

I am currently pursuing a MS/PhD in computer engineering/computer science as a second-year student at the University of Kansas under the guidance of [Professor Mohammad Alian](https://alian-eecs.ku.edu). Within the [Architecture Research Group](https://arg.ku.edu/), my focus has been on optimizing software-based architectural simulators. The goal is to enhance computer design efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Additionally, I have worked on profiling the Linux network stack and kernel-bypass network stack (such as DPDK) to identify performance bottlenecks in high-speed data center networks, and propose optimizations to improve throughput and reduce tail latency. Another area I am involved in is "Device-less Networking," which explores efficient CPU architectures to enhance I/O performance. As part of my academic involvement, I am a member of [NSBE](https://www.nsbe.org/), [ACM](https://www.acm.org/), [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) and work as a student researcher at the [ACE Center for Evolvable Computing](https://acecenter.grainger.illinois.edu/).
