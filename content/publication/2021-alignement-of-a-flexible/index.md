abstract: "Rigid platelike particles displaying interfacial slip can attain a constant orientation in a shear flow when the slip length is sufficiently large. But actual thin particles such as single-layer graphene are flexible and prone to bending deformations when exposed to shear stress. To study the effect of bending deformation on the dynamics of flexible platelike particles with large interfacial slip in a shear flow, we develop a two-dimensional (2D) fluid-structure interaction model. Our model is based on coupling the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation with a boundary integral method to solve the hydrodynamic stress at the particle surface. Emphasis is placed on resolving accurately the stress distribution at the edges of the particle. We find that (i) a stable alignment occurs even for relatively flexible particles and that (ii) edges effects on the shape of the plate are important for values of the length-to-thickness aspect ratio as large as 100. Our results are particularly relevant in view of recent research on the hydrodynamics of suspended flexible sheets made of 2D nanomaterials."
