abstract: "NMR relaxometry is a powerful and well-established
experimental approach to characterize dynamic processes in soft matter systems.
All-atom (AA) resolved simulations are typically employed to gain further
microscopic insights while reproducing the relaxation rates R1.
However, such approaches are limited to time and length-scales that 
hinder modeling of systems like long polymer chains or hydrogels.
Coarse-graining (CG) can overcome this barrier at the cost of loosing atomistic
details that impede the calculation of NMR relaxation rates. 
Here, we address this issue by systematic characterization of dipolar relaxation rates R1
while performing systematic measurements on a PEG-H2O mixture at two different 
levels of details: AA and CG. Remarkably, we show that NMR
relaxation rates R1 obtained at the CG level obey the same trends when 
compared to AA calculations, but with a systematic offset. 
This offset is due to, on the one hand, the lack of an intra-monomer
component and, on the other hand, the inexact positioning of the spin carriers.
We show that the offset can be corrected for quantitatively
by reconstructing a posteriori the atomistic details for the CG trajectories."
